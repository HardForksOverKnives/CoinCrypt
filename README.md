# CoinCrypt
An app that uses Coinbase's REST API to allow buying/selling of Ether and Bitcoin.


I decided to have git ignore "GoogleService-Info.plist". This file is generated from Firebase and is required to compile the app. If you'd like the file, feel free to contact me. Feel free to make your own Firebase project and use the file generated from your project.
